# ðŸ§  Research Whitepaper: Toward Human-Like AI Cognition

## Abstract
This paper proposes a practical cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence that mirrors essential aspects of human cognition: perception, attention, memory (short- and long-term), and meta-cognition. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we built a cloud-native system capable of learning from multi-modal data, reflecting on its relevance, and consolidating memory through a simulated dream state. The architecture is modular, explainable, and built entirely on AWS infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional AI systems process data in a stateless and context-free manner, often lacking the capacity to reason about what they know, forget unimportant information, or focus selectively. Human cognition, by contrast, is defined by its ability to:
- Attend to what matters
- Remember episodic and semantic content
- Reflect on relevance
- Sleep and consolidate experiences

This paper introduces a system that models these behaviors programmatically.

## 2. Cognitive Architecture Overview
The system consists of the following cognitive layers:

- **Sensory Buffer**: Ingests raw input from files (text, audio, video) and filters via entropy/relevance scoring.
- **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Volatile working memory stored in a vector database (OpenSearch).
- **Meta-Cognition Engine**: An LLM (via Amazon Bedrock) that analyzes attention, fatigue, and memory quality.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Filtered and consolidated high-priority items stored in a separate OpenSearch index.
- **Dream-State Processor**: Simulates memory consolidation using scheduled Lambda jobs, drawing inspiration from human sleep.

## 3. Methodology
- Files uploaded to S3 are classified and routed to AWS Textract, Transcribe, or Comprehend.
- Results are embedded and stored in STM.
- Each night, a Lambda job (dream consolidator) evaluates STM using a meta-cognitive prompt.
- The LLM outputs attention scores, fatigue indicators, and retention decisions.
- Retained memories are pushed to LTM with full metadata (timestamp, reason, score).

## 4. Meta-Cognition via Prompt Engineering
We use prompt templates that simulate self-reflection. A sample looks like:

```
Analyze the following memory:
- Is it relevant to our core goal (AI cognition)?
- How confident are you in its utility?
- Assign an attention_score (0â€“1) and explain why.

Memory:
"User transcribed audio discussing neural feedback loops..."
```

## 5. Evaluation Criteria
Human-likeness is evaluated through:
- Information prioritization
- Forgetting behaviors
- Long-term recall fidelity
- Self-assessment accuracy
- Cognitive load awareness

## 6. Related Work
Our approach builds on cognitive architectures like ACT-R, SOAR, and IBM Watson, but introduces modularity, cloud-native scalability, and modern LLM integration.

## 7. Future Work
- Add episodic/semantic distinction in LTM
- Include bias simulation
- Introduce reward-based memory reinforcement
- Implement contextual drift in attention

## Conclusion
This architecture is a step toward truly human-like AIâ€”not just in form, but in function. By simulating cognition, we empower AI to reason, prioritize, and reflect more like us.
