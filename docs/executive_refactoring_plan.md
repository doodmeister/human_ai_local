# Executive Function Refactoring - Comprehensive Implementation Plan
**Project Start**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Goal**: Transform executive modules from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated cognitive reasoning

---

## Executive Summary

This plan refactors the Executive Function components (Decision Engine, Task Planner, Goal Manager, Scheduler) to use advanced algorithms that provide:
- **Better decisions** through multi-criteria analysis (AHP, Pareto optimization)
- **Smarter planning** via GOAP and constraint satisfaction
- **Adaptive behavior** through reinforcement learning from outcomes
- **Robust scheduling** using constraint programming

---

## Current State Assessment

### Decision Engine (`src/executive/decision_engine.py` - 594 lines)
**Strengths:**
- Clean dataclass-based architecture
- Multiple decision types (choice, ranking, binary, etc.)
- Criterion abstraction with weights and evaluators
- Constraint checking capability

**Weaknesses:**
- Simple weighted sum (`WeightedScoringStrategy`)
- Static weights, no dynamic adjustment
- No learning from decision outcomes
- No trade-off visualization (Pareto analysis)
- Uncertainty handling is rudimentary

### Task Planner (`src/executive/task_planner.py` - 450 lines)
**Strengths:**
- Task dependencies and status tracking
- Cognitive load estimation
- Template-based decomposition
- Success criteria definition

**Weaknesses:**
- Templates are static, not adaptive
- No search-based planning (just templates)
- No constraint satisfaction (resources, time)
- Cannot replan dynamically
- No action precondition/effect modeling

### Goal Manager (`src/executive/goal_manager.py` - 394 lines)
**Strengths:**
- Hierarchical goal structure (parent-child)
- Progress tracking with history
- Priority levels
- Success criteria

**Weaknesses:**
- No formal goal decomposition algorithm (HTN)
- Simple progress calculation, no predictive completion
- No conflict detection between goals
- Priority is static enum, not calculated dynamically
- No resource contention handling

### Scheduler
**Current State:** No dedicated scheduler
**Issues:**
- Resource allocation scattered across modules
- No temporal constraint handling
- No optimization of task ordering

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
```bash
# Core algorithmic libraries
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn

# Optimization and constraint solving
pip install ortools python-constraint

# Graph algorithms and data structures
pip install networkx

# Data validation
pip install pydantic

# Existing dependencies (already installed)
# sentence-transformers, chromadb, fastapi, etc.
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Old APIs remain functional
2. **Gradual Migration**: Feature flags enable/disable new components
3. **Performance First**: All operations <1s for typical workloads
4. **Testability**: 90%+ code coverage, mocked external dependencies
5. **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, traces

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
```
Input: Criteria hierarchy, pairwise comparisons
Process:
  1. Build comparison matrix M (Mij = importance of i vs j)
  2. Calculate priority vector w = principal eigenvector of M
  3. Check consistency: CR = CI/RI < 0.1
Output: Normalized weights for criteria
```

#### 2. GOAP Planning
```
Input: Current state S, Goal state G, Action library A
Process:
  1. Initialize open set with goal node
  2. For each node in open set:
     a. Generate predecessors (actions that satisfy node's state)
     b. Calculate f(n) = g(n) + h(n)  [cost + heuristic]
     c. Add to open set if better path
  3. Terminate when current state reached
Output: Action sequence from S to G
```

#### 3. Constraint Satisfaction
```
Input: Variables V, Domains D, Constraints C
Process:
  1. Choose unassigned variable (using heuristics)
  2. For each value in domain:
     a. Assign value
     b. Propagate constraints (arc consistency)
     c. If consistent, recurse
     d. If solution found, return
  3. Backtrack if no valid assignment
Output: Assignment satisfying all constraints
```
