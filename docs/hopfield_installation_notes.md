# Hopfield-Layers Installation Notes

## Successfully Installed: June 3, 2025

### Package Details
- **Package**: hopfield-layers
- **Version**: 1.0.2
- **Source**: GitHub repository (ml-jku/hopfield-layers)
- **Purpose**: LSHN (Latent Structured Hopfield Networks) for episodic memory system

### Installation Method
Due to Unicode encoding issues on Windows with the standard pip installation, the package was successfully installed using:

```bash
cd /c/dev/hopfield-layers
PYTHONUTF8=1 pip install -e .
```

### Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory and install with UTF-8 encoding:
   ```bash
   cd hopfield-layers
   PYTHONUTF8=1 pip install -e .
   ```

### Key Components Available
- `Hopfield`: Main Hopfield network class
- `HopfieldLayer`: Layer implementation for neural networks
- `HopfieldPooling`: Pooling operations using Hopfield networks
- `HopfieldCore`: Core functionality

### Dependencies
- torch>=1.5.0
- numpy>=1.20.0

### Verification
The package imports successfully and basic functionality works:
```python
from hflayers import Hopfield, HopfieldLayer, HopfieldPooling
hopfield = Hopfield(input_size=128, hidden_size=64)
```

### Integration with Human-AI Cognition Project
This package enables the implementation of Latent Structured Hopfield Networks (LSHN) for:
- Episodic memory storage and retrieval
- Content-addressable memory systems
- Associative memory patterns
- Memory consolidation mechanisms

### Troubleshooting
If installation fails with Unicode errors, ensure:
1. Use `PYTHONUTF8=1` environment variable
2. Install from local cloned repository rather than direct GitHub URL
3. Ensure Windows terminal supports UTF-8 encoding
