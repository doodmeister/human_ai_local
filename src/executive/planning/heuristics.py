"""
Heuristic functions for GOAP planning.

Heuristics guide A* search toward the goal by estimating the cost to reach
the goal from any given state. Good heuristics are:

1. **Admissible**: Never overestimate the true cost (ensures optimal plans)
2. **Consistent**: h(n) â‰¤ cost(n, n') + h(n') for any neighbors n and n'
3. **Informative**: Close to true cost (reduces search space)

    Relaxed planning heuristic: estimate cost by ignoring preconditions.

    This heuristic builds a "relaxed plan" where actions can be applied
    without checking preconditions. This gives a lower bound on the true
    cost, making it admissible.

    Algorithm:
    1. Start with current state
    2. Find cheapest action that makes progress toward any goal
    3. Apply action (ignoring preconditions)
    4. Repeat until all goals satisfied
    5. Return total cost

    goal distance.

    require the full action library. For a complete implementation,
    inject the action library during planner initialization.
