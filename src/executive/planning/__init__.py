GOAP Planning Module - Goal-Oriented Action Planning

This module implements Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) for automated
task planning. GOAP uses A* search over a state space to find optimal action
sequences that achieve goals.

Components:
- world_state: State representation for planning
- action_library: Predefined actions with preconditions/effects
- goap_planner: A* search-based planner
- heuristics: Planning heuristics for efficient search
