## 🧠 Enhanced Long-Term Memory with Biologically-Inspired Features (June 2025)

### Advanced LTM Capabilities
The Long-Term Memory (LTM) system has been significantly enhanced with biologically-inspired features that mirror human memory processes:

#### 1. Salience & Recency Weighting in Retrieval
- **Dynamic Retrieval Scoring**: Memory retrieval now considers both content relevance and temporal/access patterns

- **Biological Forgetting Curves**: Implements Ebbinghaus-style forgetting with configurable decay rates
- **Importance-Based Preservation**: More important memories resist decay longer
- **Confidence Degradation**: Memory confidence naturally decreases over time without reinforcement
- **Selective Pruning**: Old, rarely accessed memories automatically lose strength

#### 3. Consolidation Tracking

## 🚀 Recent Major Update: Unified Memory Interface & Episodic Memory Improvements (June 2025)

### Unified Memory Interface
- **All major memory modules (STM, LTM, Episodic, Semantic)** now implement a consistent, type-safe interface via a shared `BaseMemorySystem` class (`src/memory/base.py`).
- **Unified API methods** for all memory systems:
  - `store(...)`: Store a new memory (returns memory ID)
  - `retrieve(memory_id)`: Retrieve a memory as a dict
  - `delete(memory_id)`: Delete a memory by ID
  - `search(query, **kwargs)`: Search for memories (returns list of dicts)
- All memory modules return dicts and use unified parameter names for easier integration and testing.

### Episodic Memory System Enhancements
- **Fallback search**: Robust fallback logic using word overlap heuristics and debug output if ChromaDB is unavailable or returns no results.
- **Related memory logic**: Improved detection of related memories (temporal, cross-reference, semantic) with debug output for explainability.
- **New/Updated Public API Methods**:
  - `get_related_memories(memory_id, relationship_types=None, limit=10)`
  - `get_autobiographical_timeline(life_period=None, start_date=None, end_date=None, limit=50)`
  - `consolidate_memory(memory_id, strength_increment=0.1)`
  - `get_memory_statistics()`
  - `clear_memory(older_than=None, importance_threshold=None)`
  - `get_consolidation_candidates(min_importance=0.5, max_consolidation=0.9, limit=10)`
  - `clear_all_memories()` (for test isolation)
- **Debug output**: All fallback and related memory logic now prints detailed debug information for transparency and troubleshooting.

### Testing & Reliability
- **Integration tests** for vector LTM and episodic memory updated to use the new interface and auto-generated summaries.
- **Test isolation**: All tests clear persistent and in-memory data before each run for clean, isolated test runs.
- **All episodic memory integration tests pass.**

- Unified public API methods: `store`, `retrieve`, `delete`, `search` (all return dicts, use unified parameter names).
- All memory modules inherit from `BaseMemorySystem` and enforce type annotations for robust, modular design.

### Episodic Memory System Improvements
- Major refactor of `EpisodicMemorySystem` (`src/memory/episodic/episodic_memory.py`):
  - Robust fallback search logic (word overlap, text match) with detailed debug output for explainability.
  - Enhanced related memory logic (cross-reference, temporal, semantic) with debug output.
  - All required public API methods implemented and exposed:
    - `get_related_memories`
    - `get_autobiographical_timeline`
    - `consolidate_memory`
    - `get_memory_statistics`
    - `clear_memory`

- Test isolation: persistent and in-memory data cleared before each run to ensure clean test runs.
- All episodic memory integration tests pass.

### Documentation
- This section documents the new unified memory interface, episodic memory improvements, new public API methods, and updated testing strategy.
- See `src/memory/base.py` for the base interface and `src/memory/episodic/episodic_memory.py` for the full implementation and debug logic.

- Unified API: Store, retrieve, search, use, delete, and clear procedural memories via the same interface as other memory types.
- **Persistence:** Procedures stored in LTM are persistent across runs; STM procedures are in-memory only.
- **Tested:** Comprehensive tests ensure correct storage, retrieval, and deletion from both STM and LTM.

### CLI Integration
- The `george_cli.py` script now supports procedural memory management:
  - `/procedure add` — interactively add a new procedure (description, steps, tags, STM/LTM)

  - `/procedure search <query>` — search procedures by description/steps
  - `/procedure use <id>` — increment usage and display steps for a procedure
  - `/procedure delete <id>` — delete a procedure by ID
  - `/procedure clear` — remove all procedural memories

### Metacognitive Reflection & Self-Monitoring (June 2025)
- **Agent-level self-reflection:** The agent can periodically or manually analyze its own memory health, usage, and performance.
- **Reflection Scheduler:** Background scheduler runs metacognitive reflection at a configurable interval (default: 10 min).
- **Manual Reflection:** Trigger a reflection at any time via CLI or API.
- **Reporting:** Reflection reports include LTM/STM stats, health diagnostics, and recommendations for memory management.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - `/reflect` — manually trigger a reflection and print summary
  - `/reflection status` — show last 3 reflection reports
  - `/reflection start [interval]` — start scheduler (interval in minutes)
  - `/reflection stop` — stop scheduler
