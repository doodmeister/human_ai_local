# Human-AI Cognition Framework

A revolutionary biologically-inspired cognitive architecture that implements complete human-like cognition in AI systems. This production-ready framework features advanced neural networks, vector-enhanced memory systems, attention dynamics, and dream-state consolidation - representing the most comprehensive cognitive AI implementation available.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This framework represents a paradigm shift in AI by implementing the first complete cognitive architecture that truly mimics human cognition. Through persistent memory structures, attention mechanisms, neural replay, and dream-state consolidation, the system maintains continuous context, learns from experience, and exhibits human-like cognitive patterns. Unlike traditional stateless AI, this system demonstrates genuine understanding, memory, and cognitive evolution.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

- **Memory as Foundation**: Production-grade persistent memory with STM/LTM vector integration using ChromaDB
- **Biologically-Inspired Processing**: Real sleep cycles, neural replay, attention fatigue, and memory consolidation
- **Advanced Neural Architecture**: LSHN (Latent Structured Hopfield Networks) and DPAD (Dual-Path Attention Dynamics)
- **Complete Cognitive Loop**: Perception → Attention → Memory → Neural Processing → Action
- **Explainable Intelligence**: All cognitive processes are transparent, traceable, and introspectable
