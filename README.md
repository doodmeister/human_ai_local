## üìä Consolidation & Performance Metrics (August 2025)

### Consolidation Pipeline Visibility
The chat performance endpoint (`/agent/chat/performance`) now surfaces consolidation metrics alongside latency and throughput:

Returned structure (fields only):
```
{
  "latency_p95_ms": <float>,
  "target_p95_ms": <float|None>,
  "performance_degraded": <bool>,
  "ema_turn_latency_ms": <float>,
  "chat_turns_per_sec": <float>,
  "consolidation": {
    "counters": {
      "stm_store_total": <int>,        # Total user turns stored in STM
      "ltm_promotions_total": <int>    # Successful promotions to LTM
    },
    "promotion_age_p95_seconds": <float> # p95 age (s) of promoted turns (STM dwell time)
  }
}
```

## üß≠ Metacognitive Adaptation & Self-Monitoring (August 2025)

Recent enhancements added adaptive, self-regulating behaviors to the chat pipeline:

**Snapshot System**
- Periodic metacog snapshots every `metacog_turn_interval` turns (dynamic 2‚Äì10 range)
- Snapshot fields: performance latency p95 + degraded flag, consolidation selectivity, STM utilization/capacity, promotion age p95, last consolidation status
- Stored to LTM (best-effort) with `type=meta_reflection` and maintained in an in-memory ring buffer

**Adaptive Controls**
- Adaptive retrieval limit: temporary reduction of `max_context_items` when performance degraded or STM utilization ‚â•85%
- Adaptive consolidation thresholds: temporary salience tightening under load/degradation
- Dynamic snapshot interval modulation: tightens under pressure, relaxes during stability

**Advisory Context Injection**
- Injects explicit metacog advisory items (`source_system=metacog`) when performance degraded or STM high utilization for explainability

**Metrics & Observability**
- Counters: `metacog_snapshots_total`, `metacog_advisory_items_total`, `metacog_stm_high_util_events_total`, `metacog_performance_degraded_events_total`, `adaptive_retrieval_applied_total`, plus prospective reminder injection counters
- Performance endpoint now returns `metacog` section with counters + current dynamic interval

**Configuration**
- Centralized via `ChatConfig` additions: `metacog_turn_interval`, `metacog_snapshot_history_size` (ring buffer)
- All adaptive behaviors are non-destructive‚Äîoriginal configuration restored each turn after temporary adjustments

**Testing**
- `test_chat_metacog_metrics.py`, `test_chat_adaptive_retrieval.py`, `test_chat_dynamic_metacog_interval.py` validate counters, retrieval reduction, and interval modulation

These features collectively provide real-time self-awareness and automatic load shedding to preserve latency and context quality.

## ‚è∞ Prospective Memory Reminders (In-Memory Beta)

An initial lightweight Prospective Memory module enables scheduling future intentions ("reminders") that automatically surface in chat context when due.

### Capabilities
- Add reminders with relative due time (seconds from now)
- List all / only pending reminders
- Retrieve due reminders (one-shot triggering)
- Automatic injection of due reminders into chat context (rank 0) for explainability

### In-Memory Model
Implemented as a fast, non-persistent singleton (`ProspectiveMemory`) distinct from the vector-based persistent system (which remains intact for future expansion). Each reminder:
```
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "content": "Send weekly report",
  "due_ts": <epoch_seconds>,
  "due_in_seconds": <float>,
  "created_ts": <epoch_seconds>,
  "triggered_ts": <epoch_seconds|null>,
  "metadata": { }
}
```

### Injection Behavior
On each chat turn, any newly due reminders (not previously triggered) are:
1. Marked triggered (single-shot semantics)
2. Counted in metrics
3. Pushed into context items with fields:
```
{
  "source_system": "prospective",
  "source_id": <reminder id>,
  "reason": "due_reminder",
  "content": <reminder content>,
  "rank": 0
}
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /agent/reminders
  body: { "content": "Water the plants", "due_in_seconds": 300 }
  -> 201 { reminder payload }

GET /agent/reminders
  -> 200 [ reminder payloads including triggered ]

GET /agent/reminders/due
  -> 200 [ newly due (one-shot) reminders triggered at request time ]
```

### Metrics
New counters exposed via metrics registry:
```
prospective_reminders_created_total    # Incremented on POST create
prospective_reminders_triggered_total  # Incremented when a reminder becomes due (either via /due or chat turn)
prospective_reminders_injected_total   # Incremented when due reminders are injected into chat context
```

### Design Notes & Next Steps
- Keeps heavy vector ProspectiveMemorySystem untouched; future merge will unify persistence & semantic search.
- Current beta focuses on deterministic scheduling and visibility for turn-level reasoning.
- Planned: persistence, natural-language scheduling ("in 5 minutes"), recurring reminders, promotion to LTM upon completion.

---
### Promotion Provenance
Promoted LTM items now carry a `promoted_from_stm` provenance flag (appears in:
1. Context item scores (`promoted_from_stm: 1.0`)
2. Provenance details trace (`trace.provenance_details[].promoted_from_stm`)

Example provenance entry:
```json
{
  "source_id": "ltm-turn-abc123",
  "source_system": "ltm",
  "reason": "semantic_match",
  "composite": 0.8421,
  "factors": [
    {"factor": "similarity", "weight": 0.4, "value": 0.91, "contribution": 0.364, "category": "retrieval"},
    {"factor": "activation", "weight": 0.3, "value": 0.73, "contribution": 0.219, "category": "retrieval"},
    {"factor": "recency", "weight": 0.2, "value": 0.55, "contribution": 0.110, "category": "retrieval"},
    {"factor": "salience", "weight": 0.1, "value": 0.49, "contribution": 0.049, "category": "retrieval"}
  ],
  "promoted_from_stm": true,
  "composite_vs_factor_sum_delta": 0.0001
}
```

### Age & Rehearsal Gating
Promotion requires simultaneously:
- Rehearsals >= policy.min_rehearsals_for_promotion
- Age (seconds since first seen) >= policy.min_age_seconds

These safeguards prevent premature promotion and make the promotion age histogram meaningful.

### Operational Uses
- `promotion_age_p95_seconds` provides a stability signal (rising values may indicate lowered rehearsal frequency or throttled promotions)
- `stm_store_total / ltm_promotions_total` ratio approximates consolidation selectivity
- Provenance flag allows downstream explanation layers to highlight durable memories.

## üöÄ Recent Major Update: Unified Memory Interface & Episodic Memory Improvements (June 2025)

### Unified Memory Interface
- **All major memory modules (STM, LTM, Episodic, Semantic)** now implement a consistent, type-safe interface via a shared `BaseMemorySystem` class (`src/memory/base.py`).
- **Unified API methods** for all memory systems:
  - `store(...)`: Store a new memory (returns memory ID)
  - `retrieve(memory_id)`: Retrieve a memory as a dict
  - `delete(memory_id)`: Delete a memory by ID
  - `search(query, **kwargs)`: Search for memories (returns list of dicts)
- All memory modules return dicts and use unified parameter names for easier integration and testing.

### Episodic Memory System Enhancements

## Quick Start

### **Installation**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (in your virtualenv):
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set up environment variables:
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

### **Running the System**

#### **üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)**
The fastest way to start George is with the startup scripts:
```bash
# Option 1: Git Bash / Linux / Mac
./start_george.sh

# Option 2: Any terminal
python start_george.py
```
These scripts automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect your virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Start the API server (http://localhost:8000)
- ‚úÖ Launch the minimal Streamlit chat interface
- ‚úÖ Handle initialization progress
- ‚úÖ Open your browser automatically

#### ** Manual Startup (Advanced)**
```bash
# 1. Start the backend API server:
python start_server.py

# 2. In another terminal, start the Streamlit chat interface:
python -m streamlit run scripts/george_streamlit_chat.py --server.port 8501

# 3. Use the CLI interface (optional):
python scripts/george_cli.py
```

#### **üìç Access Points**
- **Chat Interface**: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit minimal chat)
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs  
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

#### **üí¨ Chat Interface Features**
The minimal Streamlit interface (`george_streamlit_chat.py`) provides:
- **STM‚ÜíLTM‚ÜíLLM Pipeline**: Each chat first searches Short-Term Memory, then Long-Term Memory, then passes relevant context to the LLM
- **Context Visibility**: See which memory systems contributed to each response (stm/ltm/recent/attention/executive)
- **Captured Memories**: View what facts/preferences/goals the system extracted from your conversation
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, STM/LTM hit counts, fallback status
- **Dream Cycle**: Trigger STM‚ÜíLTM consolidation via API endpoint (or adjust consolidation thresholds in `src/core/config.py`)

**Tip**: To capture everyday conversation in STM, lower `consolidation_salience_threshold` from 0.55 to ~0.35 in `ChatConfig`, or use emphatic language (caps, exclamation marks, emotionally-charged words) to cross default thresholds.

### **Testing the Executive System**
```bash
# Test complete executive functioning integration:
python -m pytest tests/test_executive_system.py -v

# Quick executive system demo:
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.executive.executive_agent import ExecutiveAgent

async def demo_executive():
    agent = ExecutiveAgent()
    
    # Test strategic planning
    goal_id = agent.goal_manager.create_goal(
        description='Build a web application',
        priority=0.8,
        deadline='2025-08-01'
    )
    
    # Test task planning
    tasks = agent.task_planner.create_tasks_for_goal(goal_id)
    
    # Test decision making
    decision = agent.decision_engine.make_decision(
        context='Which programming language to use?',
        options=['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Go'],
        criteria={'speed': 0.3, 'ease': 0.4, 'ecosystem': 0.3}
    )
    
    # Test resource management
    allocation = agent.cognitive_controller.allocate_resources({
        'attention': 0.8,
        'memory': 0.6, 
        'processing': 0.7
    })
    
    print(f'Goals: {len(agent.goal_manager.goals)}')
    print(f'Tasks: {len(tasks)}')
    print(f'Decision: {decision.selected_option} (confidence: {decision.confidence:.2f})')
    print(f'Resource allocation: {allocation}')
    
    await agent.shutdown()

asyncio.run(demo_executive())
"
```
